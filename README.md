BUSINESS QUESTIONS
•	Which product categories generate the most revenue?
•	How do sales trends vary across different regions?
•	What impact does discounting have on profitability?
•	Which shipping mode is most preferred by customers?
•	Which product subcategories have the highest and lowest profits?
•	How can the company improve sales and profitability?

INSIGHTS 
•	Overall, the Technology category generated the highest profit ($145,454.95) for the business. Office Supplies also performed well, contributing $122,490.80 in profit. However, the Furniture category generated the lowest profit, with only $18,451.27. 

•	Sales trends vary across different regions, with the West region generating the highest sales ($725,457.82), followed by the East region with $678,781.24. The Central region recorded moderate sales of $501,239.89, while the South region had the lowest sales, contributing only $391,721.91. 

•	The impact of discounting on profitability varies across categories. Office Supplies, which had the highest discount amount ($947.80), still generated significant profit ($122,490.80), indicating that discounts may have contributed to higher sales volume and overall profitability. Technology, despite receiving the lowest discount ($244.40), had the highest profit ($145,454.95), suggesting strong demand and high margins. Furniture, with a moderate discount ($368.89), yielded the lowest profit ($18,451.27), which implies that discounts alone do not guarantee high profitability, while discounts can drive sales, their impact on profitability depends on category-specific demand and margins.

•	The most preferred shipping mode by customers is Standard Class, with a total of 5,968 orders. This is significantly higher than the other shipping modes. Second Class follows with 1,945 orders, while First Class has 1,538 orders. The least preferred shipping mode is Same Day, with only 543 orders. This suggests that customers prioritize cost-effectiveness over speed, as Standard Class is typically more affordable than expedited options.

•	The product subcategory with the highest profit is Phones, generating $44,515.73 in profit. This indicates that phones are a highly profitable product line. The subcategory with the lowest profit is Tables, which has a loss of -$17,725.48. Additionally, Bookcases (-$3,472.56) and Supplies (-$1,189.10) also recorded losses, suggesting that these items may have high costs, low margins, or significant discounting.

RECOMMENDATIONS
•	Increase focus on high-performing regions and segments.
•	Adjust pricing strategies for low-profit subcategories.
•	Optimize shipping methods to balance cost and efficiency.
•	Reduce discounts on highly profitable categories to maximize revenue.
